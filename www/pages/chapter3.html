			<p>Ray locks the car and follows her into the store. It’s cold inside. Mary is lying on the floor with her legs spread and her arms at her sides. She’s next to a wire cylinder full of kickballs. The sign over the wire cylinder says “Hot Fun in the Summertime.” Her eyes are closed. She might be sleeping there on the linoleum. Three people are standing over her. One is a dark-skinned man in khaki pants and a white shirt. A nametag on the pocket of his shirt says “<em class="small">MR. GHOSH MANAGER</em>.” The other two are<span data-page="page_3"></span> customers. One is a thin old man without much hair. He’s in his seventies at least. The other is a fat woman. She’s fatter than Mary. Fatter than the girl in the blue smock, too. Ray thinks by rights she’s the one who should be lying on the floor.</p><p>“Sir, are you this lady’s husband?” Mr. Ghosh asks.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Ray says. That doesn’t seem to be enough. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“I am sorry to say, but I think she might be dead,” Mr. Ghosh says. “I gave the artificial respiration and the mouth-to-mouth, but . . .”</p><p>Ray thinks of the dark-skinned man putting his mouth on Mary’s. French-kissing her, sort of. Breathing down her throat right next to the wire cylinder full of plastic kickballs. Then he kneels down.</p><p>“Mary,” he says. “Mary!” Like he’s trying to wake her up after a hard night.</p><p>She doesn’t appear to be breathing, but you can’t always tell. He puts his ear by her mouth and hears nothing. He feels air on his skin, but that’s probably just the air-conditioning.</p><p>“This gentleman called 911,” the fat woman says. She’s holding a bag of Bugles.</p><p>“Mary!” Ray says. Louder this time, but he can’t quite bring himself to shout, not down on his knees with people standing around. He looks up and says, apologetically, “She never gets sick. She’s healthy as a horse.”</p><p>“You never know,” the old man says. He shakes his head.</p><p>“She just fell down,” the young woman in the blue smock says. “Not a word.”</p><p>“Did she grab her chest?” the fat woman with the Bugles asks.</p><p>“I don’t know,” the young woman says. “I guess not. Not that I saw. She just fell down.”</p><p>There’s a rack of souvenir T-shirts near the kickballs. They say things like “My Parents Were Treated Like Royalty in Castle Rock and All I Got Was This Lousy Tee-Shirt.” Mr. Ghosh takes one and says, “Would you like me to cover her face, sir?”</p><p>“God, no!” Ray says, startled. “She might only be unconscious. We’re not doctors.” Past Mr. Ghosh, he sees three kids, teen-agers, looking in the window. One has a cell phone. He’s using it to take a picture.</p><p>Mr. Ghosh follows Ray’s look and rushes at the door, flapping his hands. “You kids get out of here! You kids get out!”</p><p>Laughing, the teen-agers shuffle backward, then turn and jog past the gas pumps to the sidewalk. Beyond them, the nearly deserted downtown shimmers. A car goes by pulsing rap. To Ray, the bass sounds like Mary’s stolen heartbeat.</p><p>“Where’s the ambulance?” the old man says. “How come it’s not here yet?”</p><p>Ray kneels by his wife while the time goes by. His back hurts and his knees hurt, but if he gets up he’ll look like a spectator.</p><p>The ambulance turns out to be a Chevy Suburban painted white with orange stripes. The red jackpot lights are flashing. “<em class="small">CASTLE COUNTY RESCUE</em>” is printed across the front, only backward, so you can read it in your rearview mirror.</p><p>The two men who come in are dressed in white. They look like waiters. One pushes an oxygen tank on a dolly. It’s a green tank with an American-flag decal on it. “Sorry,” he says. “Just cleared a car accident over in Oxford.”</p><p>The other one sees Mary lying on the floor. “Aw, gee,” he says.</p><p>Ray can’t believe it. “Is she still alive?” he asks. “Is she just unconscious? If she is, you better give her oxygen or she’ll have brain damage.”</p><p>Mr. Ghosh shakes his head. The young woman in the blue smock starts to cry. Ray wants to ask her what she’s crying about, then knows. She has made up a whole story about him from what he just said. Why, if he came back in a week or so and played his cards right, she might toss him a mercy fuck. Not that he <em class="">would</em>, but he sees that maybe he could. If he wanted to.</p><p>Mary’s eyes don’t react to the ophthalmoscope. One E.M.T. listens to her nonexistent heartbeat, and the other takes her nonexistent blood pressure. It goes on like that for a while. The teen-agers come back with some of their friends. Other people, too. Ray guesses they’re being drawn by the flashing red lights on top of the Suburban the way bugs are drawn to a porch light. Mr. Ghosh takes another run at them, flapping his arms. They back away again. Then, when Mr. Ghosh returns to the circle around Mary and Ray, they come back.</p><p>One of the E.M.T.s says to Ray, “She was your wife?”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Well, sir, I’m sorry to say that she’s dead.”</p><p>“Mary, Mother of God,” the fat lady with the Bugles says. She crosses herself.</p><p>“Oh.” Ray stands up. His knees crack. “They told me she was.”</p><p>Mr. Ghosh offers one of the E.M.T.s the souvenir T-shirt to put over Mary’s face, but the E.M.T. shakes his head and goes outside. He tells the little crowd that there’s nothing to see, as if anyone’s going to believe a dead woman on the Quik-Pik floor isn’t interesting.</p><p>The E.M.T. yanks a gurney from the back of the rescue vehicle. He does it with a single flip of the wrist. The legs fold down all by themselves. The old man with the thinning hair<span data-page="page_4"></span> holds the door open and the E.M.T. pulls his rolling deathbed inside.</p><p>“Whoo, hot,” the E.M.T. says, wiping his forehead.</p><p>“You may want to turn away for this part, sir,” the other one says, but Ray watches as they lift her onto the gurney. A sheet has been tucked down at the end of it. They pull it up all the way, until it’s over her face. Now Mary looks like a corpse in a movie. They roll her out into the heat. This time, the fat woman with the Bugles holds the door for them. The crowd has retreated to the sidewalk. There must be three dozen people standing in the unrelieved August sunshine.</p><p>When Mary is stored, the E.M.T.s come back. One is holding a clipboard. He asks Ray about twenty-five questions. Ray can answer all but the one about her age. Then he remembers she’s three years younger than he is and tells them thirty-five.</p><p>“We’re going to take her to St. Stevie’s,” the E.M.T. with the clipboard says. “You can follow us if you don’t know where that is.”</p><p>“I know,” Ray says. “What? Do you want to do an autopsy? Cut her up?”</p><p>The girl in the blue smock gives a gasp. Mr. Ghosh puts his arm around her, and she puts her face against his white shirt. Ray wonders if Mr. Ghosh is fucking her. He hopes not. Not because of Mr. Ghosh’s brown skin but because he’s got to be twice her age.</p><p>“Well, that’s not our decision,” the E.M.T. says, “but probably not. She didn’t die unattended—”</p><p>“I’ll say,” the woman with the Bugles interjects.</p><p>“—and it’s pretty clearly a heart attack. You can probably have her released to the mortuary almost immediately.”</p><p>Mortuary? An hour ago they were in the car, arguing. “I don’t have a mortuary,” Ray says. “Not a mortuary, a burial plot, nothing. What the hell? She’s thirty-five.”</p><p>The two E.M.T.s exchange a look. “Mr. Burkett, there’ll be someone to help you with all that at St. Stevie’s. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
